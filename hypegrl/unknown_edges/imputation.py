    Takes all the known entries in the adjacency matrix of graph ``G`` and computes the mean distance
    between pairs of nodes actually connected, and pairs of nodes not connected. For this, embeddings
    in manifold ``manifold`` are used, 
    and the distance between them is computed accordingly. Finally, the mean between the corresponding two 
    means is returned as the threshold to flag an edge. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.Graph
        The graph.
    X : np.ndarray
        The embeddings of shape ``(N,d)``, with ``N`` the number of nodes in ``G``. A correspondence between the order of each embedding
        and nx.to_numpy_array is expected.
    unknown_edges : list[tuple[int, int]]
        List of ``(m, n)`` tuples for edges whose weights are unknown, where ``m`` refers to the node's index in the resulting adjacency matrix.
    manifold : geoopt.Manifold
        A ``geoopt.Manifold`` instance defining the embedding geometry.
        Used to compute the distance between embeddings in ``X``.
